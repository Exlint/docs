### When to open or comment on a GitHub Issue

### Best practices for a smooth process

-   Provide as much information as possible - If you can't provide a minimal reproduction repository, please add as much context as possible.
    This includes environment information, code snippets, steps taken, and screenshots.
    The more information you provide, the faster we'll be able to understand and resolve the issue.
-   Check the roadmap - If Exlint currently doesn't have a certain feature, be sure to check out the roadmap to see if it's already planned for the future.
-   Follow our Code of Conduct - Please make sure to follow our Code of Conduct when interacting with the Exlint community on GitHub.
