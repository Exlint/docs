The [Exlint Action](https://github.com/Exlint/actions) is a GitHub Action that allows you to integrate Exlint into your CI (Continuous Integration) workflow.
It can help you improve the quality of your code by catching errors and potential bugs, enforcing coding standards, and identifying security vulnerabilities.

To use the Exlint Action, you must have a token and a group configured. You can get your token for CI usage on the secret management page of [app.exlint.io](https://app.exlint.io).
Read more about creating secrets [here](/setup/secret-management)

To add the Exlint Action to your workflow, include the following in your config file:

```yaml title="Github Action"
- uses: Exlint/actions@v1.0.0
  with:
      # Your configured group ID - Required
      groupId: ''
      # Your token for CI - Required
      token: ''
```

The Exlint Action will then run Exlint on your codebase and check for any issues or violations of the rules specified in your group.
