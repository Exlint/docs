# What is Exlint?

[**Exlint**](https://exlint.io) enables a quick and efficient application of multiple policy compliances in organization-wide projects.

Whether you are a senior developer, a team leader or an infrastructure owner, delivering clean, high quality code through your team/organizaition is your primary concern.
Keeping up with organizational compliance nowdays is a mess -
with some many manual files that require constant updates for each policy in every project,
compliance is always pushed back and you constantly find yourself dealing with unconvetional code and putting out fires.

## Serving Developers

Exlint is a [**CLI tool**](https://github.com/Exlint/CLI) that supports developers in enabling best practices right from the get go, easy iterations and appliances in both small scale and organizational compliance.
Our CLI solution is open source, enabling it to be supported by the Linter users community.
It's far more effective than the current manual processes, which makes it almost impossible to keep up with compliance.
Our process enables developers to catch mistakes before their code moves to the next stage, write clean code and to become better developers, while keeping up with organizational conventions.
