# Getting Started

Introducing Exlint - a powerful open-source tool for simplifying coding compliance management in your software projects.
Say goodbye to the hassle of managing standards in multiple repositories and enforce best practices with ease.

With Exlint, you can easily run centralized coding compliance checks on any project, both locally and on CI, using simple commands.
Get started now and streamline your compliance management process with Exlint.

## Quickstart

### 1. Install the Exlint CLI

To install the Exlint CLI with `npm`, run one of the following commands:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value='Global' label='Global' default>

    npm install --global @exlint.io/cli

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='Local' label='Local' default>

    npm install --save-dev @exlint.io/cli

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. ðŸš€ Run your first compliance run

Use the `go` command to quickly setup a recommended compliance and customize it in our Dashboard.

```bash
exlint go
```

Exlint will ask you for you project languages, and create a recommended compliance based on how we code at Exlint.

:::tip
Use the go command to easily get started enforcing best practices with Exlint.
You can adjust and customize the compliance for your needs, or create a new one from scratch!

## Using Exlint

### 1. Connect your CLI to your Exlint Dashboard

Use the following command to authenticate with your Exlint account:

```bash
exlint auth
```

### 2. Run an Exlint Group scan on your repository

To use a group, copy its identifier and use it with the `use` command in the Exlint CLI.
This will adjust your IDE and install necessary extensions and libraries.

```bash
exlint use <group_id>
```

Run a group scan against your code using the `run` command:

```bash
exlint run [options]
```

You can also run the command with `--fix` or `-f` option.
Providing this option will make Exlint try to automatically fix code issues.

### 3. Integrate Exlint into your CI

Keep your CI aligned with your stardartized Exlint compliance using our [GitHub Action](/ci/github-action).
Check out our [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Exlint/projects/3) to see which other integrations we're planning to support (or tell us if we're missing the one you like!)
