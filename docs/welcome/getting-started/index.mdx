## Using Exlint

### 1. Centralize your compliance in Exlint

Get started by creating an account at [app.exlint.io](https://app.exlint.io).

Create your first Exlint Group, where can organize and manage different policies, and then run them as a group.
These policies are used to check your code for compliance with industry standards and best practices.

Read more about configuring groups [here](setup/groups).

### 2. Install the Exlint CLI

To install the Exlint CLI with `npm`, run one of the following commands:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value='Global' label='Global' default>

    npm install --global @exlint.io/cli

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='Local' label='Local' default>

    npm install --save-dev @exlint.io/cli

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 3. Connect your CLI to your Exlint Dashboard

Use the following command to authenticate with your Exlint account:

    exlint auth

### 4. Run an Exlint Group scan on your repository

To use a group, copy its identifier and use it with the `use` command in the Exlint CLI.
This will adjust your IDE and install necessary extensions and libraries.

    exlint use <group_id>

Run a group scan against your code using the `run` command:

    exlint run [options]

You can also run the command with `--fix` or `-f` option.
Providing this option will make Exlint try to automatically fix code issues.

### 5. Integrate Exlint into your CI

Keep your CI aligned with your stardartized Exlint compliance using our [GitHub Action](/ci/github-action).
Check out our [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Exlint/projects/3) to see which other integrations we're planning to support (or tell us if we're missing the one you like!)
