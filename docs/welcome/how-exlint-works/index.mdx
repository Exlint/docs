# How Exlint works

Exlint is a tool that helps you maintain code quality and compliance by keeping centralizing and streamlining coding standards.
It works by running a set of linters as a group on your codebase, and identifying any issues or violations of the specified rules.

When you run Exlint, it will automatically adjust your IDE and install any necessary extensions and libraries. This allows you to see the results of the linter checks directly in your code editor.

Exlint also provides a web-based dashboard that allows you to view and manage your Exlint Groups, including adding and removing linters, and managing the configuration of your linters.
With this tool, you can easily centralize your compliance efforts and maintain code quality.

## What does Exlint analyze?

Exlint analyzes your codebase to check for issues and violations of the specified policy and linter rules.
A linter is a tool that checks for potential errors and coding standard violations in the code.
The types of issues that Exlint can analyze include:

-   Syntax errors
-   Code style violations (e.g. indentation, naming conventions)
-   Potential bugs and logical errors
-   Security vulnerabilities
-   Performance issues
-   Unused or deprecated code

Since Exlint is in beta, we only support a limited number of policies ([supported libraries](/supported-libraries)), but we're incrementally adding support for more policies and languages.
The policies which you are using in an Exlint Group will specify what type of analysis it can perform and what type of error it can detect.

## Where does the analysis occur?

Exlint's group run process is entirely local. Your files and their contents are not sent to our backend, as the CLI performs the run on your machine.
Only metadata is sent to our backend, which will be ([in progress!](https://github.com/orgs/Exlint/projects/3)) used to display your run history on your dashboard.
