Exlint's Groups feature allows you to manage and enforce coding standards across multiple projects and teams.

## What are Exlint Groups?

A Group is a set of policies that you can configure to control multiple projects together. These policies determine which libraries and plugins should be used when working with a particular group.

## Creating a Group

To create a group, you'll need to visit the Group Center page on the Exlint Dashboard. Here, you can create a new group and assign it a unique identifier.
Once you've created a group, you can configure its policies to suit your needs.

Read more about configuring policies in the [policies section](/setup/policies).

## Using a Group

To use an Exlint Group in your project, you'll first need to configure an account on the Exlint Dashboard.

Once your account is set up, use `exlint auth` to authenticate your user with Exlint.

Now you can use the group in your project by running `exlint use <group_id>` in the terminal from your project's root folder.
Exlint will configure your project with the required libraries and plugins for easy development. You can also see your linters in action if the linter support live linting.

:::tip
You can easily switch group in your project by running the `exlint use <group_id>` command again!

To run the group policies over your project, you can use the command `exlint run`. Exlint will automatically use the configured group and output the policies' results.

    exlint run [options]

You can also run the command with `--fix` or `-f` option. Providinig this option will make Exlint try to automatically fix your code issues.
