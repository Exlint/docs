# Groups

A Group is a concept of controlling multiple policies together.
This is the core of your code conventions, where you control which libraries should be used when using a group.
Using a group identifier, you will be able to run the configured policies both locally (CLI) and in a CI environment.

## Creating a Group

In the [dashboard](https://app.exlint.io), you can create a group by visiting the Group Center page.
When creating a group, it will be automatically set with an unique identifier for a later use.
After creating a group, you can configure the group's policies.

<div className={styles.imageContainer}>
	<img src="/images/create-group.png" alt="signup" className={styles.image} style={{ maxWidth: '800px' }} />
</div>

## Using a group

Using a group in your repository can be done straightforward.
Open a terminal in your project folder, and run `exlint use <group_id>`.
Exlint will configure your project with the required libraries and plugins for easy development.
You can already see your linters in action (if the linter support live linting). After configuring your project with a group,
you can run the group policies over the project by running `exlint run`.
Exlint will automatically use the configured group, and will output the policies' outputs.

:::tip
You can easily switch group in your project by running the `exlint use <group_id>` command again!
