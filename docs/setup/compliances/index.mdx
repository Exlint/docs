Exlint Compliances allows you to manage and enforce coding standards across multiple projects and teams.

## What is an Exlint Compliance?

A Compliance is a set of configurable open-source policie that can be run together on any project in a matter of seconds.

## Creating a Compliance

To create a compliance, you'll need to visit the Compliance Management page on the Exlint Dashboard. Here, you can create a new compliance which is assigned with a unique identifier.
Once you've created a compliance, you can configure its open-source policies to suit your needs.

Read more about configuring policies in the [policies section](/setup/policies).

## Running a Compliance

To use an Exlint Compliance in your project, you'll first need to configure an account on the Exlint Dashboard.

Once your account is set up, use `exlint auth` to authenticate your user with Exlint.

```bash
exlint auth
```

Now you can use the compliance in your project by running `exlint use <compliance_id>` in the terminal from your project's root folder.
Exlint will configure your project with the required libraries and plugins for easy development. You can also see your linters in action if the linter support live linting.

```bash
exlint use <compliance_id>
```

:::tip
You can easily switch compliance in your project by running the `exlint use <compliance_id>` command again!
:::

To run the compliance policies over your project, you can use the command `exlint run`. Exlint will automatically use the configured compliance and output the policies' results.

    exlint run [options]

You can also run the command with `--fix` or `-f` option. Providinig this option will make Exlint try to automatically fix your code issues.
