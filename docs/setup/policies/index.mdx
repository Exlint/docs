A Policy is a way to apply a set of rules and configurations to your code using a specific library.
This document will guide you through the process of creating and using a Policy in Exlint.

<!---
## Policy in a nutshell

1. In the [Exlint Dashboard](https://app.exlint.io), select the `Group` you want to add a new Policy to.
2. When creating a new Policy, select the open-source library you want to use for your Policy.
3. Apply the appropriate `configurations` for your Policy, following the library guidelines.
4. If the library has `rules` that can be applied, configure them as needed.
5. Run the Policy's Group to get results! ([Running a Group](/setup/groups#running-a-group))

## Configuring a Policy

Configuring an Exlint Policy consists of 4 main parts:

-   [Global Policy configurations](#global-policy-configurations) - Configurations for the policy itself
-   [File list](#file-list) - The files that the policy should run on
-   [Ignore list](#ignore-list) - The files that the policy should ignore
-   [Rules](#rules) - Customizable rules for linting and scanning code under best practices

:::info
Not all libraries require all 4.
For example, Prettier has no `Rules`, and all configuration is `Global`.

### Global Policy configurations

When configuring a global configuration, you have two options:
:::tip
Both options will produce the same result, it's just a matter of preference and ease of use.
:::

1.  `Code-based configuration`: This option allows you to input configuration using code, like you would on your IDE.
    You can set the configurations using the library's specific syntax and guidelines.

        :::caution
        When configuring using `Code-based`, policy `rules` must be included in the global configuration.
        :::

2.  `Selection (UI) based configuration`: This option allows you to set the configurations using a user interface.
    These selections will be translated into code-based configurations that can be applied to your policy.

### File list

The `File list` section allows you to specify which files the policy should run on.
This is useful if you want to only apply the policy to specific files or directories in your codebase.

To configure the File list, you can only use a code-based configuration.
This can be done by including the file paths in File list the configuration file.

You can also use wildcards such as `/*` and `/*/*` to match multiple files or directories.

Here is an example of how to use wildcards to specify all .js files in the project's directory:

```yaml title:"Exlint File list"
src/**/*.{js,jsx}
```

### Ignore list

The Ignore List is a list of files or directories that you do not want the Exlint Policy to run on.
This can be useful if you have certain files or directories that are not relevant to the Policy, or if you have files or directories that are causing errors or false positives.

Similarly to configuring the `File list`, you can specify the files or directories you want to ignore using a code-based configuration.

Here are a few examples of how to use the Ignore List:

-   To ignore a specific file, you can enter the file path, for example: `src/data/secret.js`
-   To ignore all files and directories in a certain path, you can use wildcards, for example: `src/data/*` to ignore all files and directories inside the `src/data` directory.

:::note
Be careful when using wildcards, as they can cause unexpected results if not used correctly.
:::

### Rules

The `Rules` section of an Exlint Policy allows you to customize how your code is linted and scanned for best practices, using the specific open-source library guidelines.
There are two ways to configure Rules in a Policy:

-   `Code-based configuration`: you can configure Rules in the global `Policy configurations` section of your Policy.

    :::info
    This means that the `Rules` will be configured directly in the code, just like when configuring in your IDE.
    :::

-   `Selection-based configuration`: you can also configure Rules by selecting and configuring them in the `Rules` tab of your Policy.
    This allows you to select and configure Rules using a user-friendly interface.

    -   Quickly filter out rules and enable / disable using UI.
    -   Configure rules using the same `Seletcion-based` configuration format.

    This feature is currently under maintanance and not available.
