# Policies

A Policy is a concept of controlling and configuring your code convention using a specific library.
This is where your select a library to use, and configure what rules and configurations should be applied together with your code.
Once created, you can already use your pre-created group identifier and run the policy against your code.

## Creating a Policy

In the [dashboard](https://app.exlint.io), you can create a policy by first [creating a group](https://app.exlint.io/setup/groups#creating-a-group).
When creating a group, you can right after create your first policy by clicking the "New" Button.

<div className={styles.imageContainer}>
	<img
		src="/images/create-group.png"
		alt="create a group"
		className={styles.image}
		style={{ maxWidth: '800px' }}
	/>
</div>

In the next step, you should select which library to apply with the policy.

<div className={styles.imageContainer}>
	<img
		src="/images/library-selection.png"
		alt="select a policy library"
		className={styles.image}
		style={{ maxWidth: '800px' }}
	/>
</div>

In the next step, your can apply some configurations with your policy. These configurations must follow the library guideline.

<div className={styles.imageContainer}>
	<img
		src="/images/library-selection.png"
		alt="select a policy library"
		className={styles.image}
		style={{ maxWidth: '800px' }}
	/>
</div>

For the final step, if the library has some rules to apply with, [you will able to configure some](https://app.exlint.io/setup/rules#creating-a-group).

## Using a Policy

Using a policy in your repository can be done only when [using a group](https://app.exlint.io/setup/groups#using-a-group).
