A Policy is a way to apply a set of rules and configurations to your code using a specific library. This document will guide you through the process of creating and using a Policy in Exlint.

## Policy in a nutshell

1. In the Exlint dashboard, select the group you want to add a new policy to.
2. Select the library you want to use for your Policy.
3. Apply the appropriate configurations for your Policy, following the library guidelines.
4. If the library has rules that can be applied, configure them as needed.
5. Run the Policy's Group to get results!
