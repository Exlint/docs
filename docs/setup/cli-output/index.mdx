Exlint's `run` command allows you to execute the linting and scanning of your code using the policies in a specific group.
The output of the command will display the results of each policy in the group, similar to running the linter or formatter for each library separately.

#### Examples

For example, when using the run command with a Group that includes the `Prettier` and `ESLint` policies, the output will show the results for each policy in the group.
Here is an example of what the output may look like:

```bash title="Exlint File list"
--- Prettier output ---

Checking formatting...
[warn] .vscode/settings.json
[warn] index.js
[warn] Code style issues found in 2 files. Forgot to run Prettier?


--- ESLint output ---

/Users/talrofe/Desktop/Exlint/index.js
4:1  error  File has too many lines (4). Maximum allowed is 3  max-lines

✖ 1 problem (1 error, 0 warnings)

✖ Exlint ran with a failure
```

:::note
In case of failure ,Exlint will output `✖ Exlint ran with a failure`
:::

By understanding the output, you can easily identify and fix any linting issues in your code.
