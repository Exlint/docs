Exlint provides a built-in secret management feature in the account settings.
With this feature, you can generate, name, and set an expiration for new secrets.

Here's how you can use this feature:

1. Go to the Account Settings in Exlint Dashboard
2. Navigate to the `Secret Management` section
3. Click on `Generate new secret`
4. Enter a name for the secret and select a desired expiration
5. Click on `Generate Secret` and copy the generated secret token

:::caution
After generating a new secret, it is crucial to copy the generated secret token immediately.
The token will not be accessible after leaving the page and cannot be retrieved later.
:::

6. Use the secret token for CI usage with our [GitHub Action](/ci/github-action).

By following these steps, you will be able to generate and manage your secrets in Exlint. Remember to keep your secrets secure and to refresh them before they expire.

:::note
You can also refresh a secret to generate a new token.
