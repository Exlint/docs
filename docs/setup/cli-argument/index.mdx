Exlint's command-line interface (CLI) allows you to run Exlint on your codebase from the command line. The following arguments are available:

`auth`: This argument is used to authenticate your Exlint account. You will be prompted to enter your API key.

`use`: This argument is used to specify the compliance you want to run Exlint on using its unique ID. The compliance ID can be found on the Exlint dashboard.

`run`: This argument is used to run Exlint on your codebase. The `--fix` or `-f` flag can be used to automatically fix any issues found by Exlint.

#### Examples:

To authenticate your Exlint account, you can use the following command:

```bash
exlint auth
```

To use Exlint with a specific compliance, you can use the following command:

```bash
exlint use <compliance-id>
```

To run Exlint and automatically fix any issues found, you can use the following command:

```bash
exlint run --fix
```

:::info
Please note that if you are using the `run` command, you should have previously used the `use` command to specify the compliance you want to run exlint on.
